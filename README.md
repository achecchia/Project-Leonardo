# Ender 3 Klipper Upgrade v2

This repository documents my long-term Creality Ender 3 Klipper upgrade project.

The goal is to keep this printer reliable, understandable, serviceable, reasonably fast, and eventually quieter while upgrading it in deliberate stages. This is a project-car style machine, not the primary production printer.

## Project Snapshot

Base machine:

- Creality Ender 3
- Creality v4.2.2 mainboard, **non-silent version**
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running Klipper / Mainsail / Moonraker
- GitHub-backed Klipper config history

Current phase:

- Hardware transition / commissioning phase
- Do not perform final tuning until the pending hotend, cooling, and bed-stability upgrades are installed and validated

## Project Goals

- Keep the printer reliable and maintainable
- Improve performance beyond stock Ender 3 behavior
- Make the machine quieter over time
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Preserve known-good configuration history
- Tune only after hardware changes are complete
- Create a dedicated OrcaSlicer profile after final hardware commissioning

## Completed / Current Baseline

Already installed or configured:

- Klipper, Mainsail, and Moonraker
- Raspberry Pi printer-powered setup through a buck converter
- Creality v4.2.2 non-silent mainboard running Klipper firmware
- BLTouch
- BMG-style direct-drive extruder conversion
- Pancake extruder stepper motor with corrected wiring
- Ductinator cooling duct
- Magnetic PEI build plate
- Top-mounted filament runout sensor
- Belt tensioner
- Saved bed mesh and input shaping baseline data
- Klipper-Backup with working `update_git` macro/button
- OctoEverywhere for remote status/notifications/failure monitoring
- UniFi VPN for secure full remote admin access

See [Installed Parts Inventory](docs/installed-parts.md) and [Completed / Installed Upgrades](docs/completed-upgrades.md) for links and detailed notes.

## Pending Hardware Before Final Tuning

Parts planned for installation before final tuning:

- Trianglelab 115W CHC Pro ceramic heating core kit
- Mellow all-metal bi-metal heatbreak
- Mellow Gold DLC hardened steel / copper bimetal nozzle
- Dual blower fans for the duct setup
- Silicone bed mounts/spacers to replace the bed springs

After those are installed, the printer should go through PID tuning, extrusion checks, bed mesh, retraction tuning, pressure advance, max-flow testing, speed/acceleration tuning, and OrcaSlicer profile creation.

See [Upgrade Punch List](docs/punch-list.md) for the staged process.

## Future Plans

Possible future upgrades after the current hardware phase:

- Quiet-operation upgrades
- Silent mainboard upgrade
- Dual-Z upgrade
- WLED printer lighting
- Mainboard power switching while keeping the Raspberry Pi powered
- Z-axis height extender only if usable Z height becomes a real limitation

See [Future Upgrade Ideas](docs/future-upgrade-ideas.md) for details.

## Important Reminders

- The installed Creality v4.2.2 board is the **non-silent** version, so noise reduction is an important future goal.
- The top-mounted filament runout sensor may reduce usable Z height. Final safe Z height must be matched in both `printer.cfg` and the dedicated OrcaSlicer profile.
- The runout sensor `PA4` note is a candidate until validated against the live config, trusted board pinout, or direct Klipper sensor testing.
- The pancake extruder stepper's final verified wire order is documented in [Audited Hardware Notes](docs/hardware-notes-audited.md).
- Files beginning with `ai_` are proposed AI-generated replacements and are not active unless explicitly included by the live config.

## General Rule for This Build

Back up before changing anything important.

Do not chase tuning numbers until the hardware is stable.

Keep the printer understandable, reversible, quiet where practical, and maintainable.
