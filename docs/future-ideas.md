# Future Ideas

These are ideas worth keeping track of, but they are not part of the current active upgrade phase.

This file is intentionally broader than upgrades. It can include future hardware ideas, cosmetic ideas, quality-of-life improvements, lighting, color changes, workflow changes, or anything else worth revisiting later.

The current priority is to finish the hotend, cooling, and bed-stability upgrades, then commission and tune the printer cleanly.

## Video-Inspired Ideas to Evaluate

These ideas came from the project inspiration video, **"How much can you UPGRADE an Ender 3 with $100?"** They should be treated as evaluation items, not automatic upgrades.

### G10 / Garolite Build Surface

Status: Maybe later; not needed right now.

Reason:

The video used a G10 sheet as a budget build-surface improvement. Leonardo E3 already has a magnetic PEI build plate installed, so this is not an immediate need.

Potential reason to revisit:

- If PEI adhesion/release becomes inconsistent
- If specific materials benefit from G10
- If a cheap spare surface is wanted for testing

Current decision:

Keep the PEI setup for now. Do not change the build surface until the current hardware phase is complete and first-layer behavior is evaluated after silicone bed mounts and fresh mesh.

---

### More Aggressive Part-Cooling Validation

Status: Already directionally aligned; test after installed fans are finalized.

Reason:

The video strongly emphasized part cooling as one of the highest-value Ender 3 upgrades. Leonardo E3 already has the Ductinator duct installed and dual 24V part-cooling fans planned/on hand.

Things to evaluate after fan install:

- Bridging performance
- Overhang performance
- Fan noise
- Whether full fan speed is necessary
- Whether minimum fan / maximum fan limits should be set in slicer
- Whether fan wiring is clean and serviceable

Current decision:

Do not buy different fans yet. Finish installing and testing the selected Ductinator fan setup first.

---

### CHC Hotend / High-Flow Tuning Targets

Status: Already part of active path.

Reason:

The video reinforces that extrusion flow is one of the main stock Ender 3 bottlenecks. Leonardo E3 already has the Trianglelab CHC Pro hotend, bi-metal heatbreak, and upgraded nozzle path planned.

Future test after installation:

- PID tune
- Extrusion sanity check
- Retraction tune
- Pressure advance tune
- Max volumetric flow characterization
- Realistic speed/acceleration profile in OrcaSlicer

Current decision:

No new purchase needed. Finish the already planned hotend path and tune it properly.

---

### Pressure Advance / Retraction Tuning Pass

Status: Required later.

Reason:

The video showed that speed improvements only become useful after tuning pressure advance and retraction. Leonardo E3 should not receive final values until the hotend, nozzle, cooling, and bed stability changes are complete.

Current decision:

Track this as a required commissioning step, not a hardware upgrade.

---

### Speed Benchmarks After Hardware Is Stable

Status: Later.

Reason:

The video compared stock and upgraded print times. Leonardo E3 should eventually get its own baseline and tuned benchmark profile, but only after hardware is stable.

Possible benchmark set:

- Benchy quality profile
- Benchy speed profile
- Practical functional part
- Retraction/stringing test
- Bridging/overhang test
- Dimensional accuracy test

Current decision:

Do not chase speed yet. First make the machine reliable, predictable, and documented.

## Important Future Goal

### Quiet Operation / Silent Electronics

Status: Important future goal.

Reason:

This Ender 3 has a Creality v4.2.2 mainboard, but it is the **non-silent** version. Reducing machine noise is an important long-term goal for this build.

Potential paths to quieter operation:

- Future silent mainboard upgrade, likely BTT SKR Mini E3-style or similar
- Quieter hotend, part-cooling, electronics, and PSU fans where appropriate
- Better fan control where supported
- Motion tuning that avoids unnecessary harshness without sacrificing reliability

Current decision:

Do not replace the board during the active hotend/cooling hardware phase. Keep the current 4.2.2 board until the printer is mechanically and thermally stable, then revisit quiet-operation upgrades as a focused phase.

---

## Low Priority / Optional

### Z-Axis Height Extender for Direct-Drive Clearance

Link: https://www.printables.com/model/178265-ender-3pro-z-axis-height-extender-for-direct-drive

Status: Not important right now.

Reason:

This may be useful later if the direct-drive setup, top-mounted filament sensor, or cable routing reduces usable Z height more than expected.

Current plan:

Do not install this preemptively. First complete the hotend/cooling upgrades, then physically test maximum safe Z travel.

Preferred first solution:

Reduce `position_max` in `printer.cfg` and match the reduced printable height in the dedicated OrcaSlicer profile.

Revisit only if:

- Safe usable Z height drops below an acceptable amount
- The direct-drive extruder or filament path interferes near the top of travel
- Tall prints become important for this machine

---

### BTT Mainboard Upgrade

Status: Future modernization idea, not part of the current phase.

Potential reasons to revisit later:

- Quieter stepper operation compared with the current non-silent Creality v4.2.2 board
- Software stepper-current control
- Cleaner fan control
- Independent dual-Z support
- More expansion ports
- Cleaner Klipper integration
- Better future wiring and serviceability

Preferred category if revisited:

- BTT SKR Mini E3-style board

Current decision:

Keep the Creality 4.2.2 board for now. It is working and is not the current bottleneck. Revisit later as part of a dedicated quiet-operation/electronics modernization phase.

---

### Dual-Z Upgrade

Status: Future possible upgrade, not soon.

Preferred direction:

A mechanically synchronized dual-Z setup may be the best fit for reliability and simplicity.

Revisit after:

- Hotend/cooling upgrades are complete
- Printer is tuned and reliable
- Any Z-related issue is confirmed as a real limitation

---

### Linear Rails

Status: Future possible motion upgrade.

Reason:

Linear rails may improve motion consistency, rigidity, and long-term serviceability if the stock V-wheel motion system becomes a limitation or maintenance annoyance.

Possible areas to consider later:

- X-axis rail conversion
- Y-axis rail conversion
- Full motion-system refresh if the printer is already being torn down for a larger rebuild

Current decision:

Do not install during the active hotend/cooling hardware phase. Revisit only after the printer is tuned and reliable enough to know whether the current motion system is actually limiting print quality or maintenance.

---

### Carbon Fiber Bed

Status: Future possible bedslinger weight-reduction idea.

Reason:

A lighter/stiffer bed assembly could potentially reduce moving mass on the Y axis and help with motion performance, ringing, and acceleration limits.

Things to evaluate before doing it:

- Real weight savings compared with the current bed setup
- Flatness and thermal behavior
- Heater compatibility
- Mounting compatibility with the Ender 3 bed carriage
- Whether it affects bed mesh stability or first-layer consistency

Current decision:

Track as a future idea only. Finish the current bed-stability plan first, including silicone bed mounts and a fresh mesh, before deciding whether a carbon fiber bed is worth pursuing.

---

### Logitech Camera Mount

Link: https://www.printables.com/model/970483-camera-mount-ender-3-v3-se

Status: Future quality-of-life idea; fitment not verified yet.

Reason:

A mounted Logitech camera would improve remote monitoring, print visibility, and OctoEverywhere failure/spaghetti detection.

Things to verify:

- Whether the Ender 3 V3 SE mount fits or can be adapted to this original Ender 3 frame
- Camera angle and bed coverage
- Clearance from the moving bed, gantry, toolhead, and wiring
- Cable routing to the Raspberry Pi
- Whether the mount vibrates during printing

Current decision:

Track this as an idea only until the physical fitment is checked on Leonardo E3.

---

### WLED Printer Lighting

Status: Good future quality-of-life idea.

Reason:

Better lighting will improve webcam visibility and OctoEverywhere failure/spaghetti detection.

Possible presets:

- `PRINT_START` -> bright white / camera mode
- `PRINT_END` -> complete color or soft white
- `PAUSE` -> warning color
- `CANCEL_PRINT` -> red/error color
- `IDLE` -> dim/off

Current decision:

Do this later after the mechanical and thermal upgrade path is stable.

---

### Mainboard Power Switching

Status: Future refinement.

Goal:

Keep the Raspberry Pi powered on all the time while allowing the Creality mainboard and printer electronics to be switched off from Mainsail.

Preferred architecture:

```text
24V PSU always on
├── buck converter -> Raspberry Pi always on
└── DC-rated relay/MOSFET -> Creality mainboard 24V input
```

Important note:

A USB power blocker or data-only USB cable will be required to prevent the Raspberry Pi from backfeeding the mainboard over USB when the mainboard power is off.

Current decision:

Do this later, not during the hotend/cooling upgrade phase.
