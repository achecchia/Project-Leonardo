# Completed Upgrades

This document tracks the parts, upgrades, services, and baseline calibration milestones that are already installed or configured on the Ender 3 Klipper build.

Items listed here are considered part of the current machine baseline unless otherwise noted.

https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer?srsltid=AfmBOooijRqKdK1gHTpAJgoAMWA8nOw_ZDymNjQwWoCMLoLqmY01tuOh

Notes:

- Base machine for this project.
- Original Creality Ender 3 platform.
- This printer has a Creality v4.2.2 mainboard.
- The installed v4.2.2 board is the **non-silent** version.
- Quiet operation is an important future goal for this build.
- Current Klipper config and future tuning should assume the Creality 4.2.2 board unless/until the board is upgraded.
- Stepper current is handled by physical Vref potentiometers, not software UART current control.
- A future silent-board upgrade may become worthwhile for noise reduction, even if the current board remains functional.

## Hardware Upgrades / Installed Parts

### BMG-Style Direct Drive Extruder

Status: Installed.

Source link:
https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805805447850.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.59.b0e318020SxXM1&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa

Notes:

- Replaced the stock Bowden-style extrusion setup with a BMG-style dual-gear direct drive setup.
- Current live config uses a BMG-style `rotation_distance` baseline of `7.71`.
- Final extrusion calibration should be revisited after the hotend/cooling upgrades are complete.

---

### Pancake Extruder Stepper Motor

Status: Installed and wired correctly.

Source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHHXHHRW?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title

Notes:

- Installed as part of the direct-drive conversion.
- The pancake stepper required repinning/rewiring to work correctly with the Creality 4.2.2 E-stepper port.
- Final verified connector order, left to right, is:

```text
Black, Green, Red, Blue
```

- The incorrect order `Black, Red, Blue, Green` caused a thump/noise without smooth movement, indicating a phase mismatch.
- Motor current is controlled by the physical Vref potentiometer on the Creality 4.2.2 board.
- No Klipper UART/TMC driver current control is currently active.
- Do not add `[tmc2209 extruder]` or software `run_current` settings unless the mainboard is upgraded to one with UART-controlled drivers.
- Motor temperature and torque should be evaluated after the final hotend is installed and extrusion testing begins.

More detail:

- See [`hardware-notes.md`](hardware-notes.md)

### PTFE Tube Between Extruder and Hotend

Status: Installed and working.

Source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1TVH4TW?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1

Notes:

- Used to connect the direct-drive extruder output to the hotend input.
- Current setup is working.
- Re-check tube length/fitment after final hotend, heatbreak, and cooling hardware are installed.

---

### Ductinator Cooling Duct

Status: Installed / in use for the current toolhead plan.

Source link:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6939003

Notes:

- Current BLTouch offset assumptions are based around the Ductinator-style duct placement.
- Current probe offsets in the live config are:

```ini
x_offset: 0
y_offset: -28
```

- These should be left alone unless the physical probe location changes.
- Final part-cooling performance should be tested after the two 24V duct fans are installed.

---

### Magnetic PEI Build Plate

Status: Installed.

Source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XBM24HN?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_45&th=1

Notes:

- Installed as the current removable print surface.
- Used as the baseline build plate for future slicer profile work.
- Future OrcaSlicer profile should assume a PEI build surface.
- First-layer tuning and bed temperature assumptions should be based on this surface.
- Bed mesh should be regenerated after silicone bed mounts and final hotend/toolhead work are complete.

---

### Top-Mounted Filament Runout Sensor

Status: Installed physically; final firmware behavior still needs validation.

Sensor source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V8TVK6N?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_43

Mount resource link:
https://www.printables.com/model/368594-mount-for-the-filament-sensor-for-ender-3-v2

Notes:

- Filament sensor is mounted at the top of the printer.
- Detects filament presence/runout.
- This may reduce safe usable Z height depending on filament path, toolhead clearance, and cable routing.
- User is okay with reducing Z height if needed.
- Final safe Z height must be matched in both `printer.cfg` and the dedicated OrcaSlicer profile.
- Earlier notes identify `PA4` as a likely Creality 4.2.2 DET/runout pin, but this still needs validation.
- Final sensor behavior should be tested before relying on it during long prints.

More detail:

- See [`hardware-notes.md`](hardware-notes.md)

### BLTouch

Status: Installed and working.

Source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGLM4QK8?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_44

Notes:

- BLTouch is configured as the Z virtual endstop.
- Mounted on the toolhead.
- Used for Z homing and bed probing.
- A previous Z-axis homing crash was resolved by correcting the BLTouch signal/ground wiring orientation.
- Known working wiring note: white is signal, black is ground.
- Current working BLTouch-related configuration includes:

```ini
[bltouch]
sensor_pin: ^PA7
control_pin: PB0
x_offset: 0
y_offset: -28
stow_on_each_sample: True
probe_with_touch_mode: False
pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: False
```

More detail:

- See [`hardware-notes.md`](hardware-notes.md)

---

### Belt Tensioner

Status: Installed.

Source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096M2HNP9?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_46

Notes:

- Installed to improve belt tension adjustment.
- Exact axis/location should be confirmed and documented later if needed.
- Belt tension affects motion quality, ringing, and input shaping results.
- Re-check belt tension before final speed/acceleration tuning.
- Revalidate input shaping later if belt tension or toolhead mass changes significantly.

---

### Miscellaneous Hardware Assortments

Status: On hand / used as needed.

Source links:

- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D14BC8QS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1

## Power / Electronics Setup

### Raspberry Pi Printer-Powered Setup

Status: Installed and working.

Buck converter source link:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NV3JCBC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title

Power path:

```text
Printer 24V PSU
    ↓
Buck converter stepped down to approximately 5.1V
    ↓
USB cable
    ↓
Raspberry Pi micro USB power input
```

Notes:

- The Pi is powered from the printer's 24V PSU through a buck converter.
- Power is fed into the Pi through the normal micro USB power input so the Pi's built-in fuse/protection path is retained.
- Current buck converter setup is installed and working.
- Future mainboard power-switching plans should keep the Pi powered independently of the Creality mainboard.

---

### Creality 4.2.2 Mainboard / Klipper USB Connection

Status: Installed and working.

Notes:

- The Raspberry Pi communicates with the Creality 4.2.2 board over USB.
- The installed 4.2.2 board is the non-silent version.
- Stepper currents are adjusted physically on the board through Vref potentiometers.
- No active UART-controlled TMC configuration is currently used in Klipper.
- A quieter electronics phase may eventually include a silent board upgrade.

---

## Firmware / Software / Remote Access

### Klipper + Mainsail

Status: Installed and working.

Notes:

- Klipper is running on the Raspberry Pi.
- Mainsail is the local web interface.
- Moonraker is the backend/API layer.

---

### Klipper-Backup

Status: Installed and working.

Notes:

- Klipper configuration is backed up to this GitHub repository.
- Manual backup is available through the Mainsail `update_git` button.
- Manual console backup command:

```gcode
update_git
```

- Manual console backup with message:

```gcode
update_git MESSAGE="backup message here"
```

---

### G-Code Shell Command Extension

Status: Installed and working.

Notes:

- Required for the Mainsail `update_git` macro/button to trigger Klipper-Backup from the UI.
- `shell_command.cfg` is now included by the active `printer.cfg`.

---

### OctoEverywhere for Klipper

Status: Installed.

Notes:

- Installed for cloud access, print notifications, webcam/failure monitoring, and spaghetti detection support.
- UniFi VPN remains the preferred path for higher-risk admin tasks like SSH, config edits, and Klipper/Moonraker updates.

---

## Config / Tuning Milestones Already Completed

### Bed Mesh

Status: Completed baseline mesh exists.

Notes:

- A saved bed mesh exists in the live `printer.cfg` `SAVE_CONFIG` block.
- Mesh should be regenerated after silicone bed mounts and hotend/toolhead hardware changes are complete.

---

### Input Shaping

Status: Completed baseline input shaping data exists.

Current saved values in the live config:

```ini
shaper_type_y = mzv
shaper_freq_y = 33.4
shaper_type_x = mzv
shaper_freq_x = 74.0
```

Notes:

- These are believable for the current Ender 3 bedslinger setup.
- Revalidate later only if the final toolhead mass changes significantly.
